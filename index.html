		    <h1>Our idea :</h1>
		    <p>Our idea is to compete with Castorama, this giant is one of the only ones to offer these products. It is then obvious that we can offer services and products at competitive prices.




		    </p>
		
		    <h2>How to choose?</h2>
		    <p>Choosing Outilrama means giving way to new market entrants. The objective is to have smaller warehouses but more present in the city centers. To avoid customers having to wait for the weekend to leave the city and do their shopping. (Like a neighborhood grocery store)
